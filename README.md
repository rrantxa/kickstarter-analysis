# **An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns**

## *Overview of Project*
This project was launched at the request of **Louise**, a playright who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign for "Fever", her new play. As her proposed budget is somewhat elevated (over $10,000 USD), Louise wanted to make sure that she was setting up a Kickstarter campaign that would be successful. Therefore, we analyzed a dataset that gave us relevant information about the types of crowdfunding campaigns that reach their initial goals. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze a series of crowdfunding campaigns, in order to determine the most succesful strategies for launching them. Specifically, the goal was to find relevant data to help us identify the **key characteristics** of successful theater Kickstarter campaigns.

## *Analysis and Challenges*
The analysis of this project was completed through the use of **Excel**. As stated before, we utilized a dataset that contains information on crowdfunding campaigns from all over the world. As such, the dataset not only holds data on successful campaigns, but also on canceled, failed and ongoing campaigns. 

**One of the first steps** in our analysis was to establish visual tools that would help us to quickly identify campaigns based on their outcome. Therefore, we used conditional formatting to color-code the outcomes in the following manner:
* Successful campaigns: green
* Canceled campaigns: yellow
* Failed campaigns: red
* Live campaigns: blue

After this, we worked on determining **two other factors**: the percentage of funding (according to the initial goal vs. the outcome of each campaign), and the average donation made for each project. The percentage of funding was calculated using a simple rule of three and the **ROUNDUP** formula on Excel, while the average donation was calculated with a division and the **ROUNDUP** and **IF.ERROR** formulas. 

Next, we divided the **Parent Category** and **Subcategory** from the dataset in order to have a more precise analysis on theather campaigns that allowed us to establish a specific filter for "plays". And, lastly, we created three final columns on the dataset that would give us information on **three categories**: the date a campaign was launched, the date it ended and the specific launch year. 

With all of the previous and new information on the dataset, we performed an analysis using **pivot tables**. Some of the information we got was, for example, the amount of successful theater campaigns in the United States (525, as it turns out), or the average number of backers of failed theater campaigns in that same country (and they happen to be only eight). 

However, the information we were most interested in was related to **two specific points**: the outcomes of crowdfunding campaigns based on their launch date, and the outcomes based on their crowdfunding goals. Thus, we will review this information in the next section. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## *Results*

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
